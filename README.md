# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection
To combat the risk of fraudulent activities that has risen significantly due to increasing reliance on digital payment methods this project **Online Fraud Payment Detection** uses Machine Learning techniques with Optimized Algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent online payment transactions.
We are building this project from scratch which makes it not only little bit challenging but also exciting.

**Objective:**

The primary objectives of this project are:

    1️⃣ Real-time fraud detection
    
    2️⃣ Utilizing ML models to analyze transaction data & identify patterns
    
    3️⃣ Implementing optimized algorithms to improve efficiency
    
    4️⃣ Scalability & User-Friendly integration

We welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance the project.
